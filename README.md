# arcade-quest
Project 3 of the UW Coding Boot Camp

Deployed Heroku Link:  https://nameless-plains-98133.herokuapp.com/

The project utilizes a number of technologies, including MySQL, Sequelize ORM, Express, React, Node, Passport and Bcryptjs, Axios, React Google Maps, Google Maps API, Bootstrap, and Heroku for deployment.

## USAGE :

AS AN arcade enthusiast,
I WANT TO be able to be able to find/add arcade games,
SO THAT everyone can enjoy them.

Sometimes arcade machines can be in the most random locations; some will be at arcades, some at bars or restaurants, and even some at places like laundromats or barbershops! This ssie was designed to be able to find new places to play at, share your favorite places with others, or even just try to find the most unusual place where you would never expect to find an arcade machine.

A user can add data on businesses that have arcade machines, populating them on a map on the main page with a colored marker corresponding to the type of business. Password data is encrypted so that no one besides you will know it. Clicking on a mark will show an image relating to the business, as well as arcade games they have there. There is also an option to add more arcade machines to that location. Clicking on the business name will open the location in google maps, allowing you to easily find directions to the place you decide to go.

Let's work together to try and find the most obscure arcade machines!


## INSTALLATION: 

If you wish to run locally, clone the repo. Install all node modules for root and client folders using "npm install" in both directories. Set up an empty database to use in mySql Workbench. Alter the config.json file located in the config folder to match your database, and then you can run npm start, which will initialize some tables through sequelize, as well as start the server and run the app.


## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:

We plan to add more features including a searchbar to search by business name or game. It would also be nice to include user reviews for the location aimed more toward the arcade aspect of the business than google reviews would be. Overall, we are very proud of the work we have done and are excited to add more.
